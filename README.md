# bone_lesion_classification

Transfer learning for bone lesion classification 

I built a lesion classification model to classify bone lesions caused by multiple myeloma. Since I had a limited dataset( only 3000 patches),  I used pre-trained models. The best model, ResNet50, achieved an F1-score of 0.83 on the test set.

The result is published as a paper.
